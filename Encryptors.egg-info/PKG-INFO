Description: What is this?
        -
        This is a package for Python3 containing encryption methods. May be used for encryption of your messages just for fun
        or for learning encryption method.

        Caesar encryption method
        -
        Each character in the text is replaced by a symbol located on some fixed number of positions to the
        left or to the right of it in the alphabet.
        
        Encryption of a letter x by a shift can be described mathematically as
                
            Dn(x) = (x - shift) mod n
                
        were n is cardinality of alphabet, means number of letters total.
        
        
        This module contains two realizations of Caesar encryption method:
        
        * using string transformation: `encrypt(...)` 
        
        * using modular arithmetic: `encrypt_modular(...)` for encrypt message, and `decrypt_modular(...)` for decrypt.
